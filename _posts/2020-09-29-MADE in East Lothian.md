[MADE in East Lothian](https://www.madeineastlothian.org) is an Community Arts Hub that rents a building in Haddington.

It is run by Fiona Maher, printer, artist, sculptor jewellery maker and Fiona Lambert upcycler.

They run many workshops and classes in printing, lithography, drypoint, and printing from street furniture.  

They have a small print area with a press that has been converted from a mangle that I was going to be using if they had not closed down due to second lockdown.

They also run an art for health group, outreach, tuition and commissions.

They have "maker members" who can sell and promote work and "community members" volunteers and participants.

They also run local makers markets at Tyninghame Hall.

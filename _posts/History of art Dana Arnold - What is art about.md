Ink on Paper

Printing therefore drawing

Mark Making

Being with art work in the white walls of a gallery or studio or carefully placed in a botanic garden can brings calms and a sense of     presence that is not my usual state. 

Just being present and seeing one material on another, some black ink contrasting with off-white fibrous paper, can be gorgeous.

It is as if the experience of seeing the form connects the matter to my being.

This being present is not my usual state of being and as soon as I realise this it has evaporated.

For me this presence is often found in a quiet gallery and what I am looking at is often made by artist.

But it could have been accidental, made by machine or just be. 

If looking at art an emotion may arise and I will label it good or bad, I may stay and look at the object the subject and my mind will    start to work out what it is or try and understand it and look at any labels or context.

During a particular phase of my life I started doing some screen printing and some drawing to support it and it was definitely the contemplative aspect that drew me in.           

For me the purpose of art including mine is more than its undeniable therapeutic benefit.

It is to provoke some emotion even if its apathy or indifference.

I also appreciate it as a learning or more often a re-visiting or resurrection of things forgotten than need attention.

An artist may have had an intention in making art but as viewer we bring unique histories experience hopes and fears and quite different responses to the stimulus.

So it is with my art, it is a personal investigation and exploration and provides time for what seems important.

I was in the past interested in political posters and making propaganda and reasons around making them.

The use of screen print was for practical reasons during the civil rights movements of 1968 and the images in France made collectively by those organising that struggle resonate for me today. La Lutte Continue1968  and the factory image representing the French students understanding of the working class as agents of revolutionary change internationally and influencing art students like Malcom Maclaren and Jamie Reid who was using the ransom note cut out newspaper lettering some time before he did the sex pistols cover. The shocking clashing of colours on Malcom Garretts orgasm addict Buzzcock's cover were exciting with the DIY attitude and clothes adopted by Vivien Westwood. Later I enjoyed making images with Letraset and cut up broadsheet newspapers blown up to make the grey dots part of the image and these were for specific purposes.   

I feel more connected than ever to questions of value people place in objects, what we want to collect or discard as people. What divides us and what lessons are can be learned from the past why memory is lost and buried but can be uncovered.  

Art expresses a need for a harmonious and complete life that is not possible a society that processes nature and man.

My first year was exploring materials and media and techniques. My creative practice will develop themes around what is human  what is  Nature and what it not human or nature. I interested in the debate between  Reform and Revolution as the way to change the world starting in Germany following Russian Revolution and also Capitalism as a virus that perpetuates nationalism, racism and women's oppression and shaping our institutions and art.  

A significant recent influence on me was Kath Kollwitz drawings and prints.

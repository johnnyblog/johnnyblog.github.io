# Writing about your practice

c drive

This was run as a Q&A between Rhona Taylor SSA (Art UK Sculpture Project) and Moira Jeffrey (journalist)

In the context of Covid / SSA and keeping contact:

**Q How to Get Started ?**

Not toolkits, get something done

Before this appreciate you are the expert but how to put in language ?

Visual artists are often not writers or neurotypical

How to unlock the words

Write a love letter to an artist you adore.

Write a poison letter to someone you detest.

What words do you use to describe what you feel kinship with and what turns you off.

Describe an object in your studio, not artwork. How does this object relate to your practice.

These bring in emotional response.

You are not projecting to an audience but centring around yourself.... I am interested in.. I do this...

**How would you bring in emotional connection, through note taking?**

Note taking yes, putting yourself at the centre with the emotions that connect you to your practice

But then, distancing yourself, to be very practical, see what do you need to say or do in the writing (an artists statement, in a press release, funding application etc)

**Question of using first person ?**

It is about you , not a life story, about your practice, perhaps use third person, but I am interested in your work what drives you what is the engine in the current time so it your language .

May relate to your history, but its not a big story, its where are you at now. Very concrete stuff, what issues, what materials

In short writing we don't want passive voices, and not an "art world voice"

You likely have a mentor or a friend you go to pub with, how do you speak about work to be produced in next two months ?

So, my story and then very practical, how long do I have to write it ?

What proportionate energy is needed ? does it need to be perfect ? is it needed for tomorrow ?

What do I need people to know ?

What more would I like people to know, anything critical or vital about process that helps to unlocks the work?

What do I want the audience to feel ?

You may have something around form or aesthetics that you want to remove and change to what do you want them to feel.

There is risk in imagining your audience or trying to think what your audience might look like, or imagine what a curator wants.

You are not writing for anyone except yourself.

What language do you need for a proposal document that can signal expertise etc When its a public commission outside art world for an environment or community group using "inside language" may be a barrier.

You can do this without being inconsistent.

So you will write this again and again.

Keep your core about what it means to you, but understand you may be speaking to different people with different content. What do they want out of it ?

Regarding specialist language, do you have suggestions what words, some artists are more articulate if they have a degree and confidence that may disappear when writing about personal work. What words ?

Use your own words - if its about writing in a different language than your native you may keep the language simple but there is specialist language that can be useful and can mostly be understood across languages for example in Italian or English

"International Art Speak" is something different often cliched and may be avoided.

Expert language may be required e.g. music "Grime" or "Drill" are necessary when talking about these as the words exists for a reason.

Not clich√© or bland e.g. "occupy space between this and that" but what you are doing.

**Language for funders - what do they look for ?**

I have sat on panels and also worked on individual artists applications at times when there was significant funding, so looked at many applications.

Remember basics - what will you, do when, etc

Demonstrating trust so funder has believe in artists confidence and self awareness . Funder wants artist who understands where they are at even if still evolving.

If you know where you are at and what your doing and the funder knows they are able to support you.

Tell what you are doing where you are at, any challenge being worked through or and how the funding will unlock , funder wants to be empathetic and help, reaching out and making a connection is important.

If you make connection with work and are not cliched not using tired phrases that they have seen many times

Not an emotional life story , but about this time now where you understand your work, and what is needed practically, money, tools, access to knowledge to move forward

**Other tips and on editing ?**

What are you doing ? VERBS

Specific ... not abstract - works you can mention or what you are embarking on... real concrete stuff, get it down.

Make sure images connect explicitly with what you are saying otherwise confusing or incongruous.

File things - don't press SEND - get cup of tea - will find something - even 5 mins. If possible with a friend.

Ask for help without shame same as you would for technical help . It is helpful.

Advice on moving from statement to Biography or CV

Artist Statement - Bio - CV need to tell the same story.

e.g

A cover letter can give a good story for a job but then your standard CV does not fit

Public Art - push and emphasise what's relevant.

Start in the present not dim and distant

Relevant...

I also have skills...

I am also experienced in

BIO will be 100-150 words

A mini profile at the top - perhaps one sentence or maybe two

Geared towards the desired outcome.

Is there a difficulty e.g. for an emerging artist in 50s with previous career ?

Chronological difference can be useful

I am ... I .... my previous experience includes ... (another life history)

This explains artist is primary and that's what you are about... the other stuff explains why you have alternative history and not that you have done nothing but 5 years art

It is to point at where you are going and not where you have been

so you are an active artist - not a failed solicitor/...

**Banned words ?**

"Impactful"

"What's not to like"

Anything that gives you a stomach cramp

Don't embrace it if it does not feel right

This is not to be anti art theory but the writing is about you !

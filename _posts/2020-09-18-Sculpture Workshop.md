The Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop has been at Newhaven for years and is expanding. The workshop was closed to the public due to Covid but I was able to meet Simon Burns-Cox at his studio there.
Simon works with stone and marble having trainined in Italy as a stone mason. We talked about what could feasibly be done from home with a small outdoor space and covered basic limestone carving, starting some lettering and using grinder with marble and polishing.
Coffee with Fiona Maher from MADE Haddington who was working on plaster for white concrete garden commission. Use of silicon etc.
The workshop complex is amazing with Foundry facilities for complex wax bronzing process and aluminimum and education available to enable independent work. Loading / foundry / welding area was very busy active area.

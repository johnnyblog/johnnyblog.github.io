# A Blog

- to save information and be able to share it
- to keep focussed

#### Markdown

The blog uses markdown 

I copied the Typora support blog.

I set the YAML at the top of this markdown file to say where to put the image

and to assign the category and tags

```
layout: post

category: new
tags: [change log johnny]
typora-root-url: ../
typora-copy-images-to: ../media/newjpds
```

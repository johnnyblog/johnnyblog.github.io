Out of the Blue is an arts organisation in Dalmeny Street in the old army drill hall.

They have artists studios and have also taken over the Abbeymount Techbase since Edinburgh Contemporary Crafts left.

Out of the Blue now has their publicity leaflets done by [Out of the Blue Print](https://outoftheblueprint.org/files/) who have an office with a Riso machine.

OOTB ran the Bongo Club as their cash cow.

They are a social enterprise and also do training and workshops for young people including referrals from CAMHS e.g. anxious P7s before secondary. 

The RISO machine is a temperamental duplicator machine that misregisters layers by default and is cost effective for 50-100  copies.

It works by scanning from PDF to create a master and can do halftones.

If you want more than one colour you need more than one master so it works like screen-printing.

You can create layers from original in photoshop etc or use tracing paper to trace the parts that are different colours to make the layers.

I think it would be good for a trial before a screen-print run.

They have a number of coloured cylinders and they can also be layered as with screen-print.

During the temporary easing they held an exhibition by artists using the RISO in different ways.

These are screen prints made to match the colours from the RISO prints so allowing A0+ versions of the RISO ZINE images.

This may be Matt Walpole This must have taken a lot of planning - this is one of the A5 ZINE images expanded up to the max

I think this is only two layers black and pink.

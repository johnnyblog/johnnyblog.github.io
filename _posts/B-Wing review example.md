  This review was written by Trevor H Smith an artist and freelance writer.

Interesting the review was commissioned by the curators of the B-Wing,  *[Luminara Star](http://luminarastar.co.uk/) and [Fiona Campbell](http://fionacampbellart.co.uk/)* 

B-Wing was the name of the lifers wing of former HMP Shepton Mallet closed in 2013 and open to the public in 2019 as the venue for the exhibition being reviewed.

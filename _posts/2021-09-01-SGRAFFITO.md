**Sgraffito**, (Italian: “scratched”), in the visual arts, a **technique** used in painting, pottery, and glass, which consists of putting down a preliminary surface, covering it with another, and then scratching the superficial layer in such a way that the pattern or shape that emerges is of the lower colour.

These were part of the Life Under Lockdown at Meadowbank House that I could briefly access between lockdowns. Artists had dropped by and left work for the organisers to arrange. 

The painting has to be done while plaster is wet, the Sgraffito is scratching  lime off a black board.
